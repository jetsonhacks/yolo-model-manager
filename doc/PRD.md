### Product Requirements Document: YOLO Model Manager

#### 1. Introduction

The YOLO Model Manager is a desktop application designed to simplify the process of downloading, managing, and converting YOLO models to TensorRT engines. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to interact with their model library, eliminating the need for command-line operations. The application is built using PySide6 and integrates with the Ultralytics and TensorRT libraries.

#### 2. Features

* **Model Selection and Management:**
    * The application loads available YOLO model versions and tasks from a local `models.json` configuration file.
    * Users can select a model version (e.g., Yolov8) and a specific task (e.g., Detection, Segmentation, Pose) to filter the list of available models.
    * The UI displays the download status of each model.

* **Model Download:**
    * Users can initiate the download of a selected YOLO model with a single button click.
    * The download process runs in a background thread to prevent the GUI from freezing.
    * A real-time log output displays the progress and any output from the download process.

* **TensorRT Engine Conversion:**
    * The application allows users to build TensorRT engines from a downloaded YOLO model.
    * It supports three precision modes: FP32, FP16, and INT8.
    * The UI indicates whether a specific engine has already been built.
    * The build process also runs in a separate thread, and its progress is shown in the log output.
    * For INT8 precision, the application requires the user to select a calibration dataset YAML file. It correctly handles relative paths within the YAML file to ensure the build process succeeds.

* **System Information:**
    * The UI displays the availability of a CUDA-enabled GPU and the presence of a TensorRT installation, providing quick feedback to the user on hardware and software dependencies.

* **User Interface and Experience:**
    * The application features a clean, organized layout with distinct sections for model selection, engine building, and system information.
    * Status indicators (e.g., checkmarks and crosses) visually communicate the state of downloads and engine builds.
    * A dedicated "Build Log" section provides detailed output from background tasks.
    * Users can open the local models folder directly from the application.

#### 3. Technical Requirements

* **Platform:** The application is designed to run on a desktop environment with Python 3.10 or newer.
* **Dependencies:**
    * PySide6 for the GUI framework.
    * `ultralytics` for model download and export functionality.
    * `torch` and `tensorrt` for GPU and TensorRT checks.
    * `pyyaml` for parsing calibration files.
* **Configuration:** The application requires a `models.json` file to be present in the application's root directory at startup. The application will not proceed if this file is missing or malformed.
* **Threading:** All long-running tasks (downloading, building) must be executed on a non-GUI thread to maintain a responsive user interface.
* **Error Handling:** The application must provide clear, user-friendly error messages for common issues like missing files, JSON parsing errors, or failed download/build processes.
* **File System:** The application uses the Ultralytics default weights directory for storing downloaded models and built engines. It must have read/write access to this directory.

#### 4. Future Considerations

* **Expanded Model Support:** Add support for other YOLO versions or object detection frameworks.
* **Engine Benchmarking:** Integrate a feature to run benchmarks on the built TensorRT engines to compare performance across different precisions.
* **Settings UI:** Create a settings panel to allow users to configure the models directory, default device, and other parameters.
